Notes for those wanting to help out
===================================

- Thank you!  I appreciate all feedback, pull requests, and gentle criticism!

- Open pull requests to the default branch, currently named `release`.

- Please ensure that `pytest` passes, using `pytest` itself or `tox`.

  Github runs this for you on all branches as well, and I'm working on
  getting the feedback from that integrated into the pull requests,
  eventually.

- Try to test new code thoroughly.  I'm working on increasing code
  coverage as I go as well.

- Run `flake8` and `black` to format your code.

- Add yourself to the [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.html) file if you
  want, but if you do, please also run `tools/contrib_to_about.py` to
  synchronize the changes in there to the GUI about screen.
